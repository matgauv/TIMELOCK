- Background music source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfnQIaFBKIE (not what we have to go with but honestly pretty fire)
- How to run on linux/mac (and compile with debug symbols):
  - Navigate to `ECS_DRAFT/build`.
  - Run `cmake ..` (or `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..` for debug symbols)
  - Run `make` to compile changes
  - Run `./TIMELOCK`
